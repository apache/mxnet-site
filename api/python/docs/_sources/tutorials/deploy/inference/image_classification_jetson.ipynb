    "# Image Classication using pretrained ResNet-50 model on Jetson module\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial shows how to install MXNet v1.6 with Jetson support and use it to deploy a pre-trained MXNet model for image classification on a Jetson module.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What's in this tutorial?\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial shows how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install MXNet v1.6 along with its dependencies on a Jetson module (This tutorial has been tested on Jetson Xavier AGX and Jetson Nano modules)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Deploy a pre-trained MXNet model for image classifcation on the module\n",
    "\n",
    "## Who's this tutorial for?\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial would benefit developers working on Jetson modules implementing deep learning applications. It assumes that readers have a Jetson module setup with Jetpack installed, are familiar with the Jetson working environment and are somewhat familiar with deep learning using MXNet.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "To complete this tutorial, you need:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A [Jetson module](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/develop/hardware) setup with [Jetpack 4.4](https://docs.nvidia.com/jetson/jetpack/release-notes/) installed using NVIDIA [SDK Manager](https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-sdk-manager)\n",
    "\n",
    "* An SSH connection to the module OR display and keyboard setup to directly open shell on the module\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Swapfile](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SwapFaq) installed, especially on Jetson Nano for additional memory (increase memory if the inference script terminates with a `Killed` message)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installing MXNet v1.6 with Jetson support\n",
    "\n",
    "To install MXNet with Jetson support, you can follow the [installation guide](https://mxnet.apache.org/get_started/jetson_setup) on MXNet official website.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can also directly install MXNet v1.6 wheel with Jetson support, hosted on a public s3 bucket. Here are the steps to install this wheel:\n",
    "\n",
    "*WARNING: this MXNet wheel is provided for your convenience but it contains packages that are not provided nor endorsed by the Apache Software Foundation.\n",
    "As such, they might contain software components with more restrictive licenses than the Apache License and you'll need to decide whether they are appropriate for your usage. Like all Apache Releases, the\n",
    "official Apache MXNet (incubating) releases consist of source code only and are found at https://mxnet.apache.org/get_started/download .*\n",
