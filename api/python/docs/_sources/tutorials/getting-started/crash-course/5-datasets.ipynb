A required parameter of `DataLoader` is the size of the mini-batches you want to create, called `batch_size`.\n",

    "\n",
    "Our `data_loader` loop will stop when every sample of `dataset` has been returned as part of a batch. Sometimes the dataset length isn't divisible by the mini-batch size, leaving a final batch with a smaller number of samples. `DataLoader`'s default behavior is to return this smaller mini-batch, but this can be changed by setting the `last_batch` parameter to `discard` (which ignores the last batch) or `rollover` (which starts the next epoch with the remaining samples).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Machine learning with `Dataset`s and `DataLoader`s\n",
    "\n",
    "You will often use a few different `Dataset` objects in your Machine Learning project. It's essential to separate your training dataset from testing dataset, and it's also good practice to have validation dataset (a.k.a. development dataset) that can be used for optimising hyperparameters.\n",

In this example you use the [Fashion MNIST](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist) dataset from Zalando Research.\n",

    "Many of the image `Dataset`'s accept a function (via the optional `transform` parameter) which is applied to each sample returned by the `Dataset`. It's useful for performing data augmentation, but can also be used for more simple data type conversion and pixel value scaling as seen below."
