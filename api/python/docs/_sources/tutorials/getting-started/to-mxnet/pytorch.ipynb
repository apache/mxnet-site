    "# PyTorch vs Apache MXNet\n",
    "\n",
    "[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) is a popular deep learning framework due to its easy-to-understand API and its completely imperative approach. Apache MXNet includes the Gluon API which gives you the simplicity and flexibility of PyTorch and allows you to hybridize your network to leverage performance optimizations of the symbolic graph. As of April 2019, [NVidia performance benchmarks](https://developer.nvidia.com/deep-learning-performance-training-inference) show that Apache MXNet outperforms PyTorch by ~77% on training ResNet-50: 10,925 images per second vs. 6,175.\n",

    "\n",
    "* In Apache MXNet, you need to perform the calculation within the [autograd.record()](../../../api/autograd/index.rst#mxnet.autograd.record) scope so that it can be automatically differentiated in the backward pass.\n",
    "\n",
    "* It is not necessary to clear the gradient every time as with PyTorch's `trainer.zero_grad()` because by default the new gradient is written in, not accumulated.\n",

    "* You need to specify the update step size (usually batch size) when performing [step()](../../../api/gluon/trainer.rst#mxnet.gluon.Trainer.step) on the trainer.\n",
    "\n",
    "* You need to call [.asscalar()](../../../api/legacy/ndarray/ndarray.rst#mxnet.ndarray.NDArray.asscalar) to turn a multidimensional array into a scalar.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In this sample, Apache MXNet is twice as fast as PyTorch. Though you need to be cautious with such toy comparisons.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "As we saw above, Apache MXNet Gluon API and PyTorch have many similarities. The main difference lies in terminology (Tensor vs. NDArray) and behavior of accumulating gradients: gradients are accumulated in PyTorch and overwritten in Apache MXNet. The rest of the code is very similar, and it is quite straightforward to move code from one framework to the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recommended Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "While Apache MXNet Gluon API is very similar to PyTorch, there are some extra functionality that can make your code even faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Check out [Hybridize tutorial](../../packages/gluon/blocks/hybridize.ipynb) to learn how to write imperative code which can be converted to symbolic one.\n",
