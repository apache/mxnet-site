    "One of the most critical steps for model training and inference is loading the data: without data you can’t do deep learning! In this tutorial we use the `data` module to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Define a [`Dataset`](https://beta.mxnet.io/api/gluon/_autogen/mxnet.gluon.data.Dataset.html)\n",

    "Our very first step is to define the [`Dataset`](https://beta.mxnet.io/api/gluon/_autogen/mxnet.gluon.data.Dataset.html). A [`Dataset`](https://beta.mxnet.io/api/gluon/_autogen/mxnet.gluon.data.Dataset.html) is MXNet Gluon's interface to the data that's stored on disk (or elsewhere). Out of the box, MXNet Gluon comes with a number of common benchmarking datasets such as CIFAR-10 and MNIST. We'll use an MNIST variant, called FashionMNIST, to understand the role of the [`Dataset`](https://beta.mxnet.io/api/gluon/_autogen/mxnet.gluon.data.Dataset.html). When we instantiate this benchmarking dataset, the data will be downloaded to disk and be ready to use."

    "We can access all of our samples in the dataset using the indexing method above, but usually we leave this to the [`DataLoader`](https://beta.mxnet.io/api/gluon/_autogen/mxnet.gluon.data.DataLoader.html).

Another common example with images is when you have an image with a dimension order of (height, width, channel) when you need (channel, height, width) for the network.\n",

    "Augmenting samples is also common practice: that is, randomly permuting existing samples to make new samples to reduce issues of network overfitting. Using image samples as an example, you could crop to random regions, flip from left to right or even jitter the brightness of the image.\n",

We're specifying that we want a random crop that contains 60% to 80% of the original image, and then we want to scale this cropped region to 20px by 20px. You should notice we're instantiating a class that can be called like a function."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "We've now seen all of the core components of the MXNet Gluon data pipeline. You should now understand the difference between [`Dataset`](https://beta.mxnet.io/api/gluon/_autogen/mxnet.gluon.data.Dataset.html)s, that return individual samples, and [`DataLoader`](https://beta.mxnet.io/api/gluon/_autogen/mxnet.gluon.data.DataLoader.html)s, that return batches of samples. You should also be able to transform your `dataset` for pre-processing or augmentation purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recommended Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "We used presets and a lot of default values in this tutorial, but there are many other options and possibilities. You're likely to want to use your own dataset for training. You can learn more about this in the dedicated `Dataset` tutorial. We also have a tutorial on `transform`s with examples on how to compose transform operations. And last but not least, we have a very useful tutorial on `DataLoader`s. You'll often find that loading data can be the bottleneck to training, and this tutorial contains some useful tricks to speed up the data pipeline."
