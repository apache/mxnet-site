    "# Image Augmentation\n",
    "\n",
    "Augmentation is the process of randomly adjusting the dataset samples used for training. As a result, a greater diversity of samples will be seen by the network and it is therefore less likely to overfit the training dataset. Some of the spurious characteristics of the dataset can be reduced using this technique. One example would be a dataset of images from the same camera having the same color tint: it's unhelpful when you want to apply this model to images from other cameras. You can avoid this by randomly shifting the colours of each image slightly and training your network on these augmented images.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although this technique can be applied in a variety of domains, it's very common in Computer Vision, and we will focus on image augmentations in this tutorial. Some example image augmentations include random crops and flips, and adjustments to the brightness and contrast.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What are the prerequisites?\n",
    "\n",
    "You should be familiar with the concept of a transform and how to apply it to a dataset before reading this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Where can I find the augmentation transforms?\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find them in the `mxnet.gluon.data.vision.transforms` module, alongside the deterministic transforms we've seen previously, such as `ToTensor`, `Normalize`, `CenterCrop` and `Resize`. Augmentations involve an element of randomness and all the augmentation transforms are prefixed with `Random`, such as `RandomResizedCrop` and `RandomBrightness`. We'll start by importing MXNet and the `transforms`."
