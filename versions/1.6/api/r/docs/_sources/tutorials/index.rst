MXNet R Tutorials 
======================

These tutorials for the **mxnet** R package aim to teach both practical usage of neural networks in R as well as the basic internal building blocks of MXNet. 
Each tutorial is a self-contained Juypter Notebook which you can run and modify yourself; simply download all the Notebooks into a local folder by clicking `here <mxnetRtutorials.zip>`_.

**Note**: To run the `tutorial Notebooks <mxnetRtutorials.zip>`_ on your own machine, you must first install the **mxnet** R package plus `Jupyter Notebook with the R kernel <https://www.datacamp.com/community/blog/jupyter-notebook-r>`_. Subsequently tell Juypter to use the R kernel after opening each tutorial notebook (after opening the notebook, click on: ``Kernel`` > ``Change Kernel``> ``R``).


More tutorials and examples are available in the `GitHub repository <https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/tree/master/example>`_.
For more information about MXNet, check out the `main website <http://mxnet.incubator.apache.org>`_.
The textbook `Dive into Deep Learning <http://diveintodeeplearning.org>`_ is another good resource to learn about the mathematical concepts underlying neural networks and machine learning.
