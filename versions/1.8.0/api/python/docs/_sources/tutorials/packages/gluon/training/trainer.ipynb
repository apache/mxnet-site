    "Training a neural network model consists of iteratively performing three simple steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is the forward step which computes the loss.  In MXNet Gluon, this first step is achieved by doing a forward pass by calling `net.forward(X)` or simply `net(X)` and then calling the loss function with the result of the forward pass and the labels. For example `l = loss_fn(net(X), y)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second step is the backward step which computes the gradient of the loss with respect to the parameters. In Gluon, this step is  achieved by doing the first step in an [autograd.record()](/api/python/docs/api/autograd/index.html) scope to record the computations needed to calculate the loss, and then calling `l.backward()` to compute the gradient of the loss with respect to the parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final step is to update the neural network model parameters using an optimization algorithm. In Gluon, this step is performed by the [gluon.Trainer](/api/python/docs/api/gluon/trainer.html) and is the subject of this guide. When creating a  Gluon `Trainer` you must provide a collection of parameters that need to be learnt. You also provide an `Optimizer` that will be used to update the parameters every training iteration when `trainer.step` is called.\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "* The MXNet Gluon `Trainer` API is used to update the parameters of a network with a particular optimization algorithm.\n",
    "* After the forward and backward pass, the model update step is done in Gluon using `trainer.step()`.\n",
    "* A Gluon `Trainer` can be instantiated by passing in the name of the optimizer to use and the `optimizer_params` for that optimizer or alternatively by passing in an instance of `mxnet.optimizer.Optimizer`.\n",
    "* You can change the learning rate for a Gluon `Trainer` by setting the member variable but Gluon also provides a module for learning rate scheduling.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "While optimization and optimizers play a significant role in deep learning model training, there are still other important components to model training. Here are a few suggestions about where to look next.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The [Optimizer API](/api/python/docs/api/optimizer/index.html) and [optimizer guide](/api/python/docs/tutorials/packages/optimizer/index.html) have information about all the different optimizers implemented in MXNet and their update steps. The [Dive into Deep Learning](https://en.diveintodeeplearning.org/chapter_optimization/index.html) book also has a chapter dedicated to optimization methods and explains various key optimizers in great detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Take a look at the [guide to parameter initialization](/api/python/docs/tutorials/packages/gluon/blocks/init.html) in MXNet to learn about what initialization schemes are already implemented, and how to implement your custom initialization schemes.\n",
    "- Also check out this  [guide on parameter management](/api/python/docs/tutorials/packages/gluon/blocks/parameters.html) to learn about how to manage model parameters in gluon.\n",
    "- Make sure to take a look at the [guide to scheduling learning rates](/api/python/docs/tutorials/packages/gluon/training/learning_rates/learning_rate_schedules.html) to learn how to create learning rate schedules to make your training converge faster.\n",
    "- Finally take a look at the [KVStore API](/api/python/docs/api/kvstore/index.html) to learn how parameter values are synchronized over multiple devices."
