You can follow [How to build and install MXNet with MKL-DNN backend](/api/python/docs/tutorials/performance/backend/mkldnn/mkldnn_readme.html) to build and install MXNet from source.

    "A quantization script [imagenet_gen_qsym_mkldnn.py](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/example/quantization/imagenet_gen_qsym_mkldnn.py) has been designed to launch quantization for image-classification models. This script is  integrated with [Gluon-CV modelzoo](https://gluon-cv.mxnet.io/model_zoo/classification.html), so that all pre-trained models can be downloaded from Gluon-CV and then converted for quantization. For details, you can refer [Model Quantization with Calibration Examples](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/example/quantization/README.md).\n",

If you're using Gluon, you can first refer [Saving and Loading Gluon Models](/api/python/docs/tutorials/packages/gluon/blocks/save_load_params.html) to hybridize your computation graph and export it as a symbol before running quantization.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, the quantization flow includes 4 steps. The user can get the acceptable accuracy from step 1 to 3 with minimum effort. Most of thing in this stage is out-of-box and the data scientists and researchers only need to focus on how to represent data and layers in their model. After a quantized model is generated, you may want to deploy it online and the performance will be the next key point. Thus, step 4, calibration, can improve the performance a lot by reducing lots of runtime calculation.\n",
