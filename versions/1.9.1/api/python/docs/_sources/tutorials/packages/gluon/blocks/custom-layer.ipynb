    "# Custom Layers\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- adapted from diveintodeeplearning -->\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the reasons for the success of deep learning can be found in the wide range of re-usable layers that can be used in a deep network. This allows for a tremendous degree of customization and adaptation. Sooner or later you will encounter a layer that doesn't exist yet in Gluon or one that you want to create. This is when it's time to build a custom layer. This section shows you how.\n",
    "\n",
    "Defining a layer is as easy as subclassing [nn.Block](/api/gluon/mxnet.gluon.nn.Block.html#mxnet.gluon.nn.Block) or [nn.HybridBlock](/api/gluon/mxnet.gluon.nn.HybridBlock.html#mxnet.gluon.nn.HybridBlock) and implementing `forward` or `hybrid_forward`, respectively. To take advantage of the performance gains with `nn.HybridBlock` see the section on [Hybridization](hybridize.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we've gone through rationale for defining layers, but `nn.Block`'s work even for non-sequential network. In fact, you can use a `Block` to encapsualte any re-usable architecture you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will discuss making custom layers using `nn.Block` below. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Layers without Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this is slightly intricate, we start with a custom layer that doesn't have any inherent parameters. Our first step is very similar to when we [introduced blocks](nn.md) previously. The following `CenteredLayer` class constructs a layer that subtracts the mean from the input. We build it by inheriting from the `Block` class and overriding the `forward`  and `__init__` methods."

    "## Layers with Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we know how to define layers in principle, let's define layers with parameters. These can be adjusted through training. In order to simplify things for an avid deep learning researcher, the [Parameter](/api/gluon/mxnet.gluon.parameter.html) class and the `ParameterDict` dictionary provide some basic housekeeping functionality. In particular, they govern access, initialization, sharing, saving and loading model parameters. For instance, this way we don't need to write custom serialization routines for each new custom layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can access the parameters via the `params` variable of the `ParameterDict` in `Block`. The parameter dictionary is just that - a dictionary that maps string type parameter names to model parameters in the `Parameter` type.  We can create a `Parameter` instance from `ParameterDict` via the `get` function which attempts to retrieve a parameter, or create it if not found."
