    "\n",
    "[Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX)](https://github.com/onnx/onnx) provides an open source format for AI models. It defines an extensible computation graph model, as well as definitions of built-in operators and standard data types.\n",

    "To run the tutorial you will need to have installed the following python modules:\n",
    "- [MXNet >= 1.3.0](https://mxnet.apache.org/get_started)\n",
    "- [onnx]( https://github.com/onnx/onnx#installation) v1.2.1 (follow the install guide)\n",
