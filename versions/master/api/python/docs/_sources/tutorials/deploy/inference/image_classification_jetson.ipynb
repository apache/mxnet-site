    "\n",
    "This tutorial shows how to install MXNet v1.6 with Jetson support and use it to deploy a pre-trained MXNet model for image classification on a Jetson module.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What's in this tutorial?\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial shows how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install MXNet v1.6 along with its dependencies on a Jetson module (This tutorial has been tested on Jetson Xavier AGX and Jetson Nano modules)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Deploy a pre-trained MXNet model for image classifcation on the module\n",
    "\n",
    "## Who's this tutorial for?\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial would benefit developers working on Jetson modules implementing deep learning applications. It assumes that readers have a Jetson module setup with Jetpack installed, are familiar with the Jetson working environment and are somewhat familiar with deep learning using MXNet.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "To complete this tutorial, you need:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A [Jetson module](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/develop/hardware) setup with [Jetpack 4.4](https://docs.nvidia.com/jetson/jetpack/release-notes/) installed using NVIDIA [SDK Manager](https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-sdk-manager)\n",
    "\n",
    "* An SSH connection to the module OR display and keyboard setup to directly open shell on the module\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Swapfile](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SwapFaq) installed, especially on Jetson Nano for additional memory (increase memory if the inference script terminates with a `Killed` message)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installing MXNet v1.6 with Jetson support\n",
    "\n",
    "To install MXNet with Jetson support, you can follow the [installation guide](https://mxnet.apache.org/get_started/jetson_setup) on MXNet official website.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can also directly install MXNet v1.6 wheel with Jetson support, hosted on a public s3 bucket. Here are the steps to install this wheel:\n",
