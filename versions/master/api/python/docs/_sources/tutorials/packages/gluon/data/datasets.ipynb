    "One of the most critical steps for model training and inference is loading the data: without data you can't do Machine Learning! In this tutorial we use the Gluon API to define a [Dataset](../../../../api/gluon/data/index.rst#datasets) and use a [DataLoader](../../../../api/gluon/data/index.rst#dataloader) to iterate through the dataset in mini-batches.\n",

    "## Introduction to `DataLoader`\n",
    "\n",
    "A [DataLoader](../../../../api/gluon/data/index.rst#dataloader) is used to create mini-batches of samples from a [Dataset](../../../../api/gluon/data/index.rst#datasets), and provides a convenient iterator interface for looping these batches. It's typically much more efficient to pass a mini-batch of data through a neural network than a single sample at a time, because the computation can be performed in parallel. A required parameter of `DataLoader` is the size of the mini-batches you want to create, called `batch_size`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another benefit of using `DataLoader` is the ability to easily load data in parallel using [multiprocessing](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/multiprocessing.html). You can set the `num_workers` parameter to the number of CPUs available on your machine for maximum performance, or limit it to a lower number to spare resources."

When comparing the shape of the batches to the samples returned by the `Dataset`, we've gained an extra dimension at the start which is sometimes called the batch axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our `data_loader` loop will stop when every sample of `dataset` has been returned as part of a batch. Sometimes the dataset length isn't divisible by the mini-batch size, leaving a final batch with a smaller number of samples. `DataLoader`'s default behavior is to return this smaller mini-batch, but this can be changed by setting the `last_batch` parameter to `discard` (which ignores the last batch) or `rollover` (which starts the next epoch with the remaining samples).\n",

    "You will often use a few different `Dataset` objects in your Machine Learning project. It's essential to separate your training dataset from testing dataset, and it's also good practice to have validation dataset (a.k.a. development dataset) that can be used for optimising hyperparameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Gluon `Dataset` objects, we define the data to be included in each of these separate datasets. Common use cases for loading data are covered already (e.g. [mxnet.gluon.data.vision.datasets.ImageFolderDataset](../../../../api/gluon/data/vision/datasets/index.rst#mxnet.gluon.data.vision.datasets.ImageFolderDataset)), but it's simple to create your own custom `Dataset` classes for other types of data. You can even use included `Dataset` objects for common datasets if you want to experiment quickly; they download and parse the data for you! In this example we use the [Fashion MNIST](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist) dataset from Zalando Research.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of the image `Dataset`'s accept a function (via the optional `transform` parameter) which is applied to each sample returned by the `Dataset`. It's useful for performing data augmentation, but can also be used for more simple data type conversion and pixel value scaling as seen below."

Switching to `DataLoader`'s is highly recommended when using Gluon, but you'll need to take care of pre-processing steps such as augmentations in a `transform` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "So you can get up and running with Gluon quicker if you have already implemented complex pre-processing steps using `DataIter`, we have provided a simple class to wrap existing `DataIter` objects so they can be used in a typical Gluon training loop. You can use this class for `DataIter`s such as [mxnet.image.ImageIter](../../../../api/legacy/image/index.rst#mxnet.image.ImageIter) and [mxnet.io.ImageRecordIter](../../../../api/legacy/io/index.rst#mxnet.io.ImageDetRecordIter) that have single data and label arrays."
