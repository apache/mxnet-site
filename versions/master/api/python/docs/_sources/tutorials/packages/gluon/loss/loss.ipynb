    "Loss functions are used to train neural networks and to compute the difference between output and target variable. A critical component of training neural networks is the loss function. A loss function is a quantative measure of how bad the predictions of the network are when compared to ground truth labels. Given this score, a network can improve by iteratively updating its weights to minimise this loss. Some tasks use a combination of multiple loss functions, but often you'll just use one. MXNet Gluon provides a number of the most commonly used loss functions, and you'll choose certain loss functions depending on your network and task. Some common task and loss function pairs include:\n",

    "In this tutorial we saw an example of how to evaluate model performance using loss functions (during the forward pass). Crucially, we then saw how calculate parameter gradients (using `backward`) which would minimise this loss. You should now have a better understanding of when to apply different loss functions, especially for regression vs classification tasks.\n",

    "In addition to loss functions, which are used for explicit optimization, you might want to look at metrics that give useful evaluation feedback even if they're not explicitly optimized for in the same way as the loss. You might also want to learn more about the mechanics of the backpropagation stage in the autograd tutorial."
