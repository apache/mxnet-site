    "Given the importance of learning rate and the learning rate schedule for training neural networks, there have been a number of research papers published recently on the subject. Although many practitioners are using simple learning rate schedules such as stepwise decay, research has shown that there are other strategies that work better in most situations. We implement a number of different schedule shapes in this tutorial and introduce cyclical schedules.\n",

    "While trying to push the boundaries of batch size for faster training, [Priya Goyal et al. (2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02677) found that having a smooth linear warm up in the learning rate at the start of training improved the stability of the optimizer and lead to better solutions. It was found that a smooth increases gave improved performance over stepwise increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "We look at \"warm-up\" in more detail later in the tutorial, but this could be viewed as a specific case of the **\"triangular\"** schedule that was proposed by [Leslie N. Smith (2015)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01186). Quite simply, the schedule linearly increases then decreases between a lower and upper bound. Originally it was suggested this schedule be used as part of a cyclical schedule but more recently researchers have been using a single cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "One adjustment proposed by [Jeremy Howard, Sebastian Ruder (2018)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06146) was to change the ratio between the increasing and decreasing stages, instead of the 50:50 split. Changing the increasing fraction (`inc_fraction!=0.5`) leads to a **\"slanted triangular\"** schedule. Using `inc_fraction<0.5` tends to give better results."

    "As an example, we implement the triangular cyclical schedule presented in [\"Cyclical Learning Rates for Training Neural Networks\" by Leslie N. Smith (2015)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01186). We use slightly different terminology to the paper here because we use `cycle_length` that is twice the 'stepsize' used in the paper. We repeat cycles, each with a length of 500 iterations and lower and upper learning rate bounds of 0.5 and 2 respectively."
