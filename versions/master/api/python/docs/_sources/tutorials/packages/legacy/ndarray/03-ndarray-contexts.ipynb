    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "* [MXNet installed (with GPU support) in a Python environment](https://mxnet.apache.org/get_started).\n",

    "## Managing Context\n",
    "\n",
    "In MXNet, every array has a context.\n",
    "One context could be the CPU. Other contexts might be various GPUs.\n",
    "Things can get even hairier when we deploy jobs across multiple servers.\n",
    "By assigning arrays to contexts intelligently, we can minimize\n",
    "the time spent transferring data between devices.\n",
    "For example, when training neural networks on a server with a GPU,\n",
    "we typically prefer for the model's parameters to live on the GPU.\n",
    "If you have a GPU, let's try initializing an array on the first GPU.\n",
    "Otherwise, use `ctx=mx.cpu()` in place of `ctx=gpu(0)`."
